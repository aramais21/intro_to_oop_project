## Running Tests

To run tests, you can run the tester classes

- LinearEquationTester - to Run this you will need to create or use one of the .txt files in the dataExamples folder. For different Fields you have to use differnet .txt patter. 
    - For exmaple for SimpleNumber's you have to create a file in this format:

    ```
    SIMPLE
    {{rowCount in this case 2}}
    {{columnCount in this case 3}}
    4 3 11
    5 -3 7
    ```

    - For exmaple for ModularNumber's you have to create a file in this format:

    ```
    MODULAR
    {{rowCount in this case 2}}
    {{columnCount in this case 3}}
    {{base in this case 7}}
    4 3 11
    5 -3 7
    ```

    - For exmaple for ComlexNumver's you have to create a file in this format:

    ```
    COMPLEX
    {{rowCount in this case 2}}
    {{columnCount in this case 3}}
    {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}} {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}} {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}}
    {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}} {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}} {{REAl}} {{IMAGINERY}}
    ```
- QuadraticEquationTester - to Run this you will need to compile and run that file, after which it will ask you to write the 3 coefficient a, b, c
